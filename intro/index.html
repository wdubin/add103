    <h1>William's Introduction</h1>
    <h2>Apples</h2>
        <h3>Macintosh</h3>
        <p>A Macintosh is one of the healthiest apples on the planet. 
            Macintosh and any other apples is good for your heart. 
            I eat an apple once or sometimes twice per day. 
        </p>

    <h2>Waterfall</h2>
        <h3>Forest Waterfall</h3>
        <p>A Waterfall is one of the most beautiful things to see. 
            Some of the waterfalls can be either straight or curvy. 
            The only largest waterfall I ever seen is Niagara Falls.
