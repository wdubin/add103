      <h2>Locations</h2>
      <p>
        Located in North America, the country is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and to 
        the east by the Atlantic Ocean. Along the northern border is Canada and the southern border 
        is Mexico. There are 50 states and the District of Columbia. Stretching from the northeastern 
        states down to Florida, this region borders the Atlantic Ocean. It encompasses both low-lying,
        swampy areas in the south and more elevated regions to the north. Moving westward, you 
        encounter the Appalachian Mountains, which extend from the Canadian province of Quebec to 
        northern Alabama. These mountains were among the first regions settled by Europeans during 
        the colonial period. Beyond the Appalachians lies the vast expanse of the Interior Lowlands, 
        also known as the Great Plains. This region covers much of the central United States and 
        extends into Canada. The Great Plains are characterized by prairies and fertile soil, making 
        them a hub for agriculture. Further west, the landscape rises into the majestic Rocky 
        Mountains. This region spans a significant portion of western North America and boasts some 
        of the continentâ€™s highest peaks, including Mount Elbert. To the west of the Rockies lie the 
        Intermontane Plateaus, including the Columbia and Colorado Plateau. This area also contains 
        the Great Basin, a largely arid region characterized by deserts and salt flats. Along the 
        western edge of the continent lies the Pacific Coast Range. This includes the coastal 
        mountains along the Pacific Ocean, extending from Alaska down to California. </p>
