        I love traveling to different states in this country. From coastlines to big cities, the United States 
        is made up of so many diverse destinations that it's hard to decide which places deserve the distinction 
        of the best in America. Whether you’re a seasoned traveler or just starting your journey, this map allows 
        you to mark the states you’ve visited. It’s like creating a visual travel diary! You can adjust the map’s 
        width, height, and zoom level to fit your preferences. Make it as compact or detailed as you like. 
        Hovering over a state reveals its name, making it easy to identify each one. Once you’ve selected the 
        states you’ve visited, share your personalized map with friends and family on social media. Brag about 
        your adventures or inspire others to explore! Simply copy and paste the provided HTML code to display your 
        interactive map. Every state has its unique charm and attractions. You can explore the bustling streets of 
        New York City, hiked the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, or relaxed on the beaches of Florida. Whether you are 
        a first-time visitor or returning to explore more of the USA, the US State map below provides a great way 
        of exploring different destinations and understanding how they fit together. The United States of America 
        is a country that is so vast that one visit is never enough! it truly has some great places to explore. 
        While America’s big cities often grab the limelight the nation’s state capitals are also worth a closer look.
