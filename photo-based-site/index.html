        I love traveling to different states in this country. From coastlines to big cities, the 
        United States is made up of so many diverse destinations that it's hard to decide which 
        places deserve the distinction of the best in America. Whether you’re a seasoned traveler 
        or just starting your journey, this map allows you to mark the states you’ve visited. It’s 
        like creating a visual travel diary! You can adjust the map’s width, height, and zoom level 
        to fit your preferences. Make it as compact or detailed as you like. Hovering over a state 
        reveals its name, making it easy to identify each one. Once you’ve selected the states you’ve 
        visited, share your personalized map with friends and family on social media. Brag about your 
        adventures or inspire others to explore! Simply copy and paste the provided HTML code to 
        display your interactive map. Every state has its unique charm and attractions. You can 
        explore the bustling streets of New York City, hiked the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, or 
        relaxed on the beaches of Florida. Whether you are a first-time visitor or returning to 
        explore more of the USA, the US State map below provides a great way of exploring different 
        destinations and understanding how they fit together. The United States of America is a 
        country that is so vast that one visit is never enough! it truly has some great places to 
        explore. While America’s big cities often grab the limelight the nation’s state capitals are 
        also worth a closer look.

        <h2>Travel</h2>
        I would like to travel to every state in the United States. The United States of America is a 
        country that is so vast that one visit is never enough! it truly has some great places to 
        explore. While America’s big cities often grab the limelight the nation’s state capitals are 
        also worth a closer look. Although some capitals are also their state’s main tourism hubs – 
        such as Denver, Boston and Nashville – others are smaller but no less lively or captivating. 
        Weekends away in America’s lesser-known capital cities are the next big thing. Montpelier, 
        Vermont, the smallest of all 50 state capitals, is big on arts, music, world beating 
        breweries and eating out, for example, while others like Carson City, Nevada, are popular 
        bases for outdoor activities. Head on down to Tennessee for a taste of the real America and 
        to experience the best of its musical heritage. Tennessee is all about authentic experiences. 
        Whether in the major cities of Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville, or Chattanooga, or in some of 
        America’s most inspiring small towns, like Franklin, Collierville, or Cleveland, Tennessee 
        delivers hospitality and a true American experience. Alternatively, holiday in the state of 
        Kentucky where southern hospitality is what it’s all about in the Bluegrass State. Here 
        visitors can taste bourbon, enjoy the races, and explore the great outdoors. Kentucky is 
        home to Mammoth Cave, the longest cave system in the world, as well as thousands of miles 
        of waterways. Explore Washington D.C., the nation’s capital and home to the US President and 
        Congress with many important government buildings and monuments to explore.

        <h2>States</h2>
        A state of the United States is one of the 50 constituent entities that shares its 
        sovereignty with the federal government. Americans are citizens of both the federal republic 
        and of the state in which they reside, due to the shared sovereignty between each state and 
        the federal government. Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia use the term 
        commonwealth rather than state in their full official names. States are the primary 
        subdivisions of the United States. The United States of America is a federal republic 
        consisting of 50 states, a federal district, five major territories, and various minor islands. 
        Both the states and the United States are each sovereign jurisdiction. The United States has control over 
        fourteen territories. Five of them, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, 
        Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have a permanent, nonmilitary population, while. 
        nine of them do not. Except for Navassa Island, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which are located 
        in the Caribbean, all territories are in the Pacific Ocean. One territory, Palmyra Atoll, is considered to 
        be incorporated, meaning the full body of the Constitution has been applied to it; the other 
        territories are unincorporated, meaning the Constitution does not fully apply to them. The 
        four other territories are organized, meaning an organic act has been enacted by Congress. 
        The largest state by population is California, with a population of 39,538,223 people, while 
        the smallest is Wyoming, with a population of 576,851 people; the federal district has a 
        larger population 689,545 than both Wyoming and Vermont.

        <h2>Landmarks</h2>
        From icons like the Statue of Liberty to vast natural wonders like the Grand Canyon, there 
        are many famous US landmarks that are must-sees! The Grand Canyon, located in the "Grand 
        Canyon State," is a geological wonder formed millions of years ago by the Colorado River. 
        The canyon is 278 miles long, 18 miles wide, and over a mile deep. It is the largest canyon 
        in the United States. Forever a symbol of hope and freedom in New York City, the Statue of 
        Liberty is one of the most famous monuments in the United States. One of the most notable 
        icons of New York City, the Empire State Building, towers over the Manhattan skyline at 1450 
        feet. Perhaps the most famous waterfall in the world, Niagara Falls lies on the border 
        between New York and Canada. It is the largest waterfall in North America and one of the most 
        famous landmarks of the US; some would also say the world! One of the most famous US 
        monuments, the Washington Monument is a 555-foot marble tower erected to honor the nation's 
        first president, George Washington. Constructed in the 1930s to supply water and 
        hydroelectric power to neighboring desert regions, the Hoover Dam was considered a modern 
        marvel of its time. Nothing more ironically represents San Francisco than the 746-foot tall, 
        orange-hued Golden Gate Bridge. This San Francisco landmark spans 1.7 miles over the Golden 
        Gate Strait connecting San Francisco to Marin County. Established in 1872 as the world's 
        first National Park, Yellowstone has been delighting visitors with its natural beauty and 
        splendor for over 150 years.

        <h2>Locations</h2>
        Located in North America, the country is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and to 
        the east by the Atlantic Ocean. Along the northern border is Canada and the southern border 
        is Mexico. There are 50 states and the District of Columbia. Stretching from the northeastern 
        states down to Florida, this region borders the Atlantic Ocean. It encompasses both low-lying,
        swampy areas in the south and more elevated regions to the north. Moving westward, you 
        encounter the Appalachian Mountains, which extend from the Canadian province of Quebec to 
        northern Alabama. These mountains were among the first regions settled by Europeans during 
        the colonial period. Beyond the Appalachians lies the vast expanse of the Interior Lowlands, 
        also known as the Great Plains. This region covers much of the central United States and 
        extends into Canada. The Great Plains are characterized by prairies and fertile soil, making 
        them a hub for agriculture. Further west, the landscape rises into the majestic Rocky 
        Mountains. This region spans a significant portion of western North America and boasts some 
        of the continent’s highest peaks, including Mount Elbert. To the west of the Rockies lie the 
        Intermontane Plateaus, including the Columbia and Colorado Plateau. This area also contains 
        the Great Basin, a largely arid region characterized by deserts and salt flats. Along the 
        western edge of the continent lies the Pacific Coast Range. This includes the coastal 
        mountains along the Pacific Ocean, extending from Alaska down to California
