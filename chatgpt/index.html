        Hiking can help reduce anxiety and depression
      </h2>
      <p>
        Being out in nature away from all forms of technology is something that 
        everybody should do at least once in a while. Hiking allows you to step 
        away from the normal distractions of everyday life and enjoy some peace 
        while away.

      <h2>You get numerous health benefits from even a weekly short hike</h2>
      <p>
        Moving around and exercising for just 30 minutes each day can help with 
        fatigue, sleep issues, creativity, and happiness levels. It may seem 
        surprising to hear this, but being outside in nature can help both 
        mentally and physically.

      <h2>It can be a pretty inexpensive hobby to get involved in</h2>
      <p>
        There aren’t too many things that are required to begin hiking. 
        If you have a decent pair of shoes and a bottle of water, the only 
        other thing you need to do is find a location to go. Most areas have 
        a few places that could be perfect for hiking and exercise.

      <h2>The exercise received while hiking releases endorphins which can work to boost your happiness</h2>
      <p>
        It’s often stated that exercise and moving your body can help reduce 
        stress levels and increase your overall happiness. Hiking works the 
        same and in some cases works even better! Being outdoors and enjoying 
        nature while also getting exercise will do wonders in making you 
        appreciate life and boost happiness.

      <h2>Regular hiking will strengthen your heart, muscles, lungs, and mind</h2>
      <p>
        Hiking can be an intense full-body workout in that almost every muscle 
        will be used. You may be sore after a full day of hiking, but just know 
        that the feeling is a good thing that is working to help keep your body 
        and heart strong and healthy.

      <h2>Hiking will increase your personal connections to nature</h2>
      <p>
        If you’re skeptical about this fact, I advise you to spend a little bit 
        of time exploring nature each day. For some people it may not be true, 
        but after a week of getting outside each day I feel more alive and 
        grounded in my connection to nature and to the world!
      </p>

        Ready to get started? Grab some water bottles, head out the door,
        and start hiking today!
