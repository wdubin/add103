            <h3>Ornaments</h3>
            The ornaments are the most important part of a christmas tree. You can hang them up anywhere on the tree 
            wherever you want. The ornaments are shiny and glittery, some of them can be in different colors, like red, 
            blue, or green. Most of the ornaments can be round and sphere, some others can be oval, diamond, or even 
            the shape of a top or the shape of an egg. The first decorated trees were adorned with apples, 
            candy canes and pastries in the shapes of stars, hearts and flowers. Queen Victoriaâ€™s consort, 
            Prince Albert, is generally credited with importing the Christmas tree custom from his native 
            Germany in 1841. The idea of decorating a treefor Christmas began in Germany, where they used to 
            add fruits and nuts to trees once the leaves fell off to symbolize the promise of spring to come. 
            But in 1605, a fur tree was brought inside and adorned with paper roses, candles, nuts, and fruits.
            The most common materials for modern Christmas ornaments are glass, metal, plastic and wood. 
            Ornaments come in a nearly infinite number of shapes, but some of the most common ones are ball 
            ornaments. Other materials used to make Christmas ornaments include holly leaves, holly twigs, 
            pine cones, hickory nuts, and acorns. Glass ornaments were mouth-blown into nuts and fruit molds 
            made of clay.
