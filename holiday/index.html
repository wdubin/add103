            <h3>Ornaments</h3>
            The ornaments are the most important part of a christmas tree. You can hang them up anywhere on the tree 
            wherever you want. The ornaments are shiny and glittery, some of them can be in different colors, like red, 
            blue, or green. Most of the ornaments can be round and sphere, some others can be oval, diamond, or even 
            the shape of a top or the shape of an egg.

            <h3>Lights</h3>
            Christmas lights, also known as fairy lights, festive lights, or string lights, are used for decoration 
            during the Christmas season. They are often displayed on Christmas trees, homes, and other festive 
            locations.  The tradition of using Christmas lights dates back to 1923 when President Calvin Coolidge 
            started celebrating Christmas with the National Christmas Tree lighting.

            <h3>Tree-topper</h3>
            A tree-topper or treetopper is a decorative ornament placed on the top of a Christmas tree. Tree-toppers 
            can take any form, though the most common include a star, angel, or fairy. Tree-toppers may be made of from 
            a wide range of materials. Modern plastic tree-toppers are often electric and once connected with the
            tree's lights offer a gentle glow.
